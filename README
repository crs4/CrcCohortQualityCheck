Quality Check is a program that compares the compositions uploaded in the EHRBase server with the original XML files for the CRC_Cohort data
So it needs the crc_cohort xml/s and the EHRBase server, where the compositions have been inserted, running

N.B.  dictact.py is the file where the patient number is mapped to its ehr id and composition id (of the only composition it contains)
the first time you run the check make sure to delete dictact.py if existent.  It will be recreated with the right mappings.

How to run
to run: python3 CheckConversionInsertion.py

usage: CheckConversionInsertion.py [-h] [--loglevel LOGLEVEL] [--inputdir INPUTDIR] [--basename BASENAME]
                                   [--templatename TEMPLATENAME] [--fileindex FILEINDEX] [--check]

optional arguments:

  --loglevel LOGLEVEL   the logging level:DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR or CRITICAL
  --inputdir INPUTDIR   dir containing the xmls
  --basename BASENAME   basename to filter xml
  --templatename TEMPLATENAME
